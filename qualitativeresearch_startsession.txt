A comprehensive tool for initializing a new qualitative research session, providing structured information about ongoing research projects, participants, analytical elements, and recent research activities.

When to use this tool:
- Beginning a new research analysis session
- Getting oriented to your current research state across multiple projects
- Planning which research elements to focus on in the current session
- Reviewing recent research activities and progress
- Identifying active research projects and their status
- Exploring available participants for analysis
- Reviewing your most frequently used codes
- Accessing recent analytical memos
- Establishing research context before diving into specific analysis tasks
- Re-engaging with your research after time away
- Prioritizing high-priority research tasks
- Tracking the status of various research activities
- Understanding sequential research processes

Key features:
- Generates a unique session identifier for tracking research activities
- Retrieves and displays recent research sessions with summaries
- Lists active research projects with status and phase information
- Provides a sample of research participants with demographic information
- Presents your most frequently used codes with reference counts
- Highlights recent analytical memos with type and summary information
- Formats information in an easily scannable format for quick orientation
- Integrates with the loadcontext tool for deeper exploration
- Maintains continuity between research sessions
- Tracks research session history for progress review
- Displays high-priority research tasks needing attention
- Shows status information for key research activities
- Presents sequential relationships between research processes

Parameters explained:
No parameters required - the tool automatically retrieves all relevant context.

Return information:
- A unique session identifier
- Recent research sessions (up to 3) with:
  * Date
  * Project name
  * Brief summary
- Active research projects with:
  * Project name
  * Current status
  * Research phase
- Sample participants (up to 5) with:
  * Participant name
  * Demographic information
  * Participation status
- Top codes (up to 10) with:
  * Code name
  * Reference count
  * Code group
- Recent memos (up to 3) with:
  * Memo name
  * Creation date
  * Memo type
  * Brief summary
- High-priority research tasks (up to 5) with:
  * Task name
  * Current status
  * Associated project
- Upcoming research activities (up to 3) with:
  * Activity name
  * Scheduled date
  * Prerequisite activities
  * Current status

Status and Priority Information:
- Research activities are displayed with their current status values
- High-priority tasks are prominently highlighted for attention
- Valid status values include: planning, data_collection, analysis, writing, complete, scheduled, conducted, transcribed, coded, analyzed, emerging, developing, established, preliminary, draft, final, active, in_progress
- Priority values (high, low) help indicate which tasks need immediate attention

Sequential Process Information:
- Upcoming activities show prerequisite tasks that must be completed first
- Research phases are presented in their logical sequence
- The precedes relation is used to determine activity ordering
- Sequential relationships help visualize the research workflow

Session Workflow:
1. Start a research session with startsession
2. Review the provided context to decide what to focus on
3. Use loadcontext to retrieve detailed information about specific research elements
4. Conduct your analysis, adding new elements with buildcontext as needed
5. End the session with endsession to record your research progress

You should:
- Begin each focused research period with startsession to establish context
- Review recent sessions to maintain continuity in your research
- Identify active projects that require attention
- Note available participants for interview analysis
- Consider frequently used codes that may indicate important patterns
- Review recent memos to reconnect with your analytical thinking
- Prioritize high-priority tasks for immediate attention
- Check the status of research activities to maintain progress awareness
- Consider sequential relationships when planning your research activities
- Use the session ID when using other tools to maintain session tracking
- After completing a session, record your progress using endsession
- Establish a regular cadence of research sessions to maintain momentum
- Use the structured overview to make deliberate choices about where to focus your analytical effort
