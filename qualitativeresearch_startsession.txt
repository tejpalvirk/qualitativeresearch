- Reviewing recent research activities and progress
- Identifying active research projects and their status
- Exploring available participants for analysis
- Reviewing your most frequently used codes
- Accessing recent analytical memos
- Establishing research context before diving into specific analysis tasks
- Re-engaging with your research after time away

Key features:
- Generates a unique session identifier for tracking research activities
- Retrieves and displays recent research sessions with summaries
- Lists active research projects with status and phase information
- Provides a sample of research participants with demographic information
- Presents your most frequently used codes with reference counts
- Highlights recent analytical memos with type and summary information

Session Workflow:
1. Start a research session with startsession
2. Review the provided context to decide what to focus on
3. Use loadcontext to retrieve detailed information about specific research elements
4. Conduct your analysis, adding new elements with buildcontext as needed
5. End the session with endsession to record your research progress

You should:
- Begin each focused research period with startsession to establish context
- Review recent sessions to maintain continuity in your research
- Identify active projects that require attention
- Note available participants for interview analysis
- Consider frequently used codes that may indicate important patterns
- Review recent memos to reconnect with your analytical thinking
- Use the session ID when using other tools to maintain session tracking
- After completing a session, record your progress using endsession
- Establish a regular cadence of research sessions to maintain momentum
- Use the structured overview to make deliberate choices about where to focus your analytical effort
