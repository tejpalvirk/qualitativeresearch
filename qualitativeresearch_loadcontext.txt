Load Context Tool for Qualitative Research

A sophisticated tool for retrieving rich, contextual information about qualitative research entities, providing structured insights tailored to different research components.

When to use this tool:
- Retrieving detailed information about research projects, participants, interviews, and analytical elements
- Exploring thematic analyses and research findings
- Reviewing participant profiles and interview transcripts
- Examining code definitions and their connections to data
- Analyzing emerging themes and their supporting evidence
- Investigating research questions and related findings
- Reviewing analytical memos and their connections to data
- Preparing for coding sessions by establishing contextual understanding
- Exploring relationships between codes, themes, and concepts
- Getting a comprehensive overview of project progress and insights

Key features:
- Provides richly formatted, context-aware information about research entities
- Adapts output format based on entity type (project, participant, interview, code, theme, memo, researchQuestion)
- Presents both direct entity information and related research elements
- Shows research design, methodology, and analysis progression
- Tracks entity views within the current research session
- Formats information in a structured, readable markdown format
- Highlights relationships between research elements
- Presents supporting quotes and evidence for themes and codes
- Shows co-occurrence patterns between codes where available

Parameters explained:
1. entityName: Required - The name of the entity to retrieve context for
  - Example: "Health Behavior Study", "Participant_P001", "Interview_20230315"
2. entityType: Optional - The type of entity being retrieved
  - Default: "project"
  - Helps the system format the output appropriately
  - Common types include: "project", "participant", "interview", "code", "theme", "memo", "researchQuestion"
3. sessionId: Optional - The current session identifier
  - Typically provided by startsession
  - Used for tracking entity views within the session

Each entity type returns specialized context information:
- Project: Shows project status, description, research design, research questions, data collection stats, recent interviews, analysis progress (themes), and findings
- Participant: Displays demographic information, interview history, observation records, notable quotes, and research memos
- Interview: Shows project affiliation, participant, date, transcript content, applied codes, and notable quotes
- Code: Displays definition, status, creation date, code group affiliations, supporting quotes, sources, associated themes, and code co-occurrence data
- Theme: Shows description, status, creation date, project affiliation, supporting codes, example quotes, and analytical memos
- Memo: Displays topic, date, project affiliation, content, and related entities
- Research Question: Shows the question text, project affiliation, related findings, themes, and supporting quotes
- Other Entity Types: Shows observations and relationship information for other entity types

Return information:
- Formatted markdown text with hierarchical structure
- Sections adapted to the specific entity type
- Related entities shown with their descriptions and connections
- Error messages if the entity doesn't exist or can't be retrieved

You should:
- Specify the exact entity name for accurate retrieval
- Provide the entity type when possible for optimally formatted results
- Start with project entities to get a high-level overview of research
- Use participant context to understand individual perspectives
- Examine interview context to see coding applied to raw data
- Review code context to understand analytical categories
- Explore theme context to see patterns and theoretical constructs
- Use research question context to track progress toward answering key inquiries
- Examine memo context to review analytical insights
- After retrieving context, follow up on specific entities of interest
- Use in conjunction with startsession to maintain session tracking
- Remember that this tool only retrieves existing information; use buildcontext to add new entities
