A versatile tool for constructing and enhancing the qualitative research knowledge graph by adding new research elements, relationships, and observations.

When to use this tool:
- Creating new research entities (projects, participants, interviews, observations, codes, themes, memos, etc.)
- Establishing relationships between research elements (e.g., connecting participants to projects, codes to data segments)
- Adding observations, notes, or content to existing research entities
- Building the research corpus incrementally as data collection and analysis progress
- Organizing and structuring qualitative data within your research framework
- Documenting emerging themes, codes, and analytical insights during research
- Creating research questions and linking them to findings
- Building code hierarchies and thematic frameworks
- Setting status values for research activities and entities
- Assigning priorities to research tasks and activities
- Defining sequential relationships between research processes

Key features:
- Creates three distinct types of knowledge graph elements: entities, relations, and observations
- Supports specialized qualitative research entity types (projects, participants, interviews, observations, documents, codes, etc.)
- Validates entity and relation types against predefined standards for the qualitative research domain
- Handles batch creation of multiple entities or relations in a single operation
- Returns confirmation with details of created elements
- Ensures proper data typing and structure for the qualitative research knowledge graph
- Enables comprehensive documentation of the research process
- Supports status and priority assignment through entity-relation model
- Enables sequential relationships through precedes relation

Parameters explained:
1. type: The type of creation operation to perform
  - Accepts: "entities", "relations", or "observations"
  - Determines how the data parameter is interpreted
2. data: The content to add to the knowledge graph (structure varies by type):
  - For "entities": An array of objects, each containing:
    * name: Unique identifier for the entity
    * entityType: One of the valid entity types (project, participant, interview, observation, document, code, codeGroup, memo, theme, quote, literature, researchQuestion, finding, status, priority)
    * observations: Array of strings containing notes or properties about the entity
  - For "relations": An array of objects, each containing:
    * from: Name of the source entity
    * to: Name of the target entity
    * relationType: The type of relationship between entities (e.g., "participated_in", "codes", "has_status", "has_priority")
  - For "observations": Either a single object or an array of objects, each containing:
    * entityName: Name of the entity to add observations to
    * contents: Array of strings with new observations to add

Valid entity types:
- project: Overall research study
- participant: Research subjects
- interview: Formal conversation with participants
- observation: Field notes from observational research
- document: External materials being analyzed
- code: Labels applied to data segments
- codeGroup: Categories or families of related codes
- memo: Researcher's analytical notes
- theme: Emergent patterns across data
- quote: Notable excerpts from data sources
- literature: Academic sources
- researchQuestion: Formal questions guiding the study
- finding: Results or conclusions
- status: Entity status values
- priority: Entity priority values

Valid relation types:
- participated_in: Links participants to interviews/observations
- codes: Shows which codes apply to which data
- contains: Hierarchical relationship
- supports: Data supporting a theme or finding
- contradicts: Data contradicting a theme or finding
- answers: Data addressing a research question
- cites: References to literature
- followed_by: Temporal sequence
- related_to: General connection
- reflects_on: Memo reflecting on data/code/theme
- compares: Comparative relationship
- has_status: Links entity to its status
- has_priority: Links entity to its priority
- precedes: Entity comes before another entity in sequence

Status information:
- Valid status values include: planning, data_collection, analysis, writing, complete, scheduled, conducted, transcribed, coded, analyzed, emerging, developing, established, preliminary, draft, final, active, in_progress
- Status is assigned through the has_status relation type

Priority information:
- Valid priority values: high, low
- Priority is assigned through the has_priority relation type

Return information:
- JSON response indicating success or failure
- For successful operations:
  * Success flag set to true
  * Details of created elements in the "created" field (for entities/relations) or "added" field (for observations)
- For failed operations:
  * Success flag set to false
  * Error message describing the issue

Error handling:
- Validates entity types against the predefined list for qualitative research
- Validates relation types against acceptable standards
- Returns descriptive error messages for invalid inputs
- Gracefully handles type mismatches and formatting errors

You should:
- Use consistent naming conventions for entities to facilitate relationships and retrieval
- Begin by creating projects and participants before more specific research elements
- Add detailed observations to entities to enhance context and retrievability
- Create relationships to build a comprehensive network of interconnected research data
- Use has_status relations to track the progress of research activities
- Use has_priority relations to indicate important research elements
- Use the precedes relation to establish sequences in research processes
- Use observations to document the evolution of codes, themes, and analytical thinking
- Regularly update entity observations as your understanding evolves
- Build hierarchical structures using relations (e.g., codes within code groups, themes connecting multiple codes)
- Document the full research journey by adding memos tied to specific analytical moments
- Link quotes to codes, themes, and findings to maintain evidential chains
