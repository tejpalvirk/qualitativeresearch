A versatile tool for constructing and enhancing the qualitative research knowledge graph by adding new research elements, relationships, and observations.

When to use this tool:
- Creating new research entities (projects, participants, interviews, observations, codes, themes, memos, etc.)
- Establishing relationships between research elements (e.g., connecting participants to projects, codes to data segments)
- Adding observations, notes, or content to existing research entities
- Building the research corpus incrementally as data collection and analysis progress
- Organizing and structuring qualitative data within your research framework
- Documenting emerging themes, codes, and analytical insights during research
- Creating research questions and linking them to findings
- Building code hierarchies and thematic frameworks

Key features:
- Creates three distinct types of knowledge graph elements: entities, relations, and observations
- Supports 13 specialized qualitative research entity types (projects, participants, interviews, observations, documents, codes, code groups, memos, themes, quotes, literature, research questions, findings)
- Validates entity and relation types against predefined standards for the qualitative research domain
- Handles batch creation of multiple entities or relations in a single operation
- Returns confirmation with details of created elements
- Ensures proper data typing and structure for the qualitative research knowledge graph
- Enables comprehensive documentation of the research process

Parameters explained:
1. type: The type of creation operation to perform
  - Accepts: "entities", "relations", or "observations"
  - Determines how the data parameter is interpreted
2. data: The content to add to the knowledge graph (structure varies by type):
  - For "entities": An array of objects, each containing:
    * name: Unique identifier for the entity
    * entityType: One of the valid entity types (project, participant, interview, observation, document, code, codeGroup, memo, theme, quote, literature, researchQuestion, finding)
    * observations: Array of strings containing notes or properties about the entity
  - For "relations": An array of objects, each containing:
    * from: Name of the source entity
    * to: Name of the target entity
    * relationType: The type of relationship between entities
  - For "observations": Either a single object or an array of objects, each containing:
    * entityName: Name of the entity to add observations to
    * contents: Array of strings with new observations to add

Return information:
- JSON response indicating success or failure
- For successful operations:
  * Success flag set to true
  * Details of created elements in the "created" field (for entities/relations) or "added" field (for observations)
- For failed operations:
  * Success flag set to false
  * Error message describing the issue

Error handling:
- Validates entity types against the predefined list for qualitative research
- Validates relation types against acceptable standards
- Returns descriptive error messages for invalid inputs
- Gracefully handles type mismatches and formatting errors

You should:
- Use consistent naming conventions for entities to facilitate relationships and retrieval
- Begin by creating projects and participants before more specific research elements
- Add detailed observations to entities to enhance context and retrievability
- Create relationships to build a comprehensive network of interconnected research data
- Use observations to document the evolution of codes, themes, and analytical thinking
- Regularly update entity observations as your understanding evolves
- Build hierarchical structures using relations (e.g., codes within code groups, themes connecting multiple codes)
- Document the full research journey by adding memos tied to specific analytical moments
- Link quotes to codes, themes, and findings to maintain evidential chains
